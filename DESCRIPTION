Package: beachmat.hdf5
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2023-08-07
Title: beachmat bindings for HDF5-backed matrices
Description: 
    Extends beachmat to support initialization of tatami matrices from HDF5-backed arrays.
    This allows C++ code in downstream packages to directly call the HDF5 C/C++ library to access array data,
    without the need for block processing via DelayedArray.
    Some utilities are also provided for direct creation of an in-memory tatami matrix from a HDF5 file.
